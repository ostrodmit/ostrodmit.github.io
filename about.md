My name is [__Dmitrii. M. Ostrovskii__](http://www.dostrovsky.com/). 
I am a postdoc at INRIA Paris in the group of [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).
I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Grenoble, supervised by [Anatoli Juditsky](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html) (now at the University of Washington, Seattle).

I work on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, such as: 
* statistical optimality;
* algorithmic efficiency;
* adaptivity to the unknown structure and parameters;
* robustness.

The purpose of this blog is to present my research to a broader audience.
