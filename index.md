## About ##

I am currently a postdoc at #USC (Viterbi School)# hosted by [Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/research/). Before that, I was on a 1.5-year postdoc at Inria Paris working with [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/). I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Grenoble Alpes, supervised by [Anatoli Juditsky](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html).

## Research Interests ##

I work on various theoretical aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, such as: 
* statistical optimality and fast learning rates
* efficient algorithms
* adaptivity to the unknown structure and parameters
* robustness
