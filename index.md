In 2019--2021 I was a postdoc at USC working with [__Meisam Razaviyayn__](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/research/). In the previous 1.5 years I was an ERCIM Alain Bensoussan fellow at Inria Paris with [__Francis Bach__](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).  
I defended my PhD thesis in 2018. I was advised by [__Anatoli Juditsky__](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [__Zaid Harchaoui__](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html) and collaborated with Arkadi Nemirovski.

## Research ##

I work on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, in particular:  
* statistical optimality and fast learning rates
* efficient optimization algorithms, in particular for min-max optimization
* adaptation to unknown structure and parameters
* robust statistics
* hypothesis testing

See my [__research statement__](assets/research_statement.pdf) for more details.
