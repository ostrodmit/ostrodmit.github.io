I am a postdoc at Inria Paris
in the [group](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) of [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).
I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Grenoble Alpes, supervised by [Anatoli Juditsky](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html).

## Research Interests ##

I work on various theoretical aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, such as: 
* statistical optimality and fast learning rates
* efficient algorithms
* adaptivity to the unknown structure and parameters
* robustness

I keep updated my list of [__publications__](/papers) and my [__Google Scholar profile__](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=2IvZJ3cAAAAJ&hl=en).

You are also welcomed to consult my [__CV__](assets/dmitrii_ostrovskii_CV.pdf) and [__research statement__](assets/research_statement.pdf).

I also maintain the research blog [__Look at the Corners__](https://ostrodmit.github.io/blog/), feel free to have a look.
