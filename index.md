In 2019--2021 I was a postdoc at USC Viterbi with [Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/research/).   Previously, I was an ERCIM A. Bensoussan fellow at Inria Paris hosted by [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).  
I graduated with a PhD in 2018. My advisors were [Anatoli Juditsky](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html).
