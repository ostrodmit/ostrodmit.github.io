## About ##

I'm an Assistant Professor (RTPC) of Mathematics at __University of Southern California__.  
  
Previously I was a postdoc at USC working with [__Meisam Razaviyayn__](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/research/) (2019-2021) and an ERCIM Alain Bensoussan fellow at Inria Paris under [__Francis Bach__](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/) (2018-2019).  
  
I defended my PhD thesis in early 2018, under [__Anatoli Juditsky__](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [__Zaid Harchaoui__](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html).

## Research ##

I work on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, in particular:  
* statistical optimality and fast learning rates
* efficient optimization algorithms, in particular for min-max optimization
* adaptation to unknown structure and parameters
* robust statistics
* hypothesis testing

See my [__research statement__](assets/research_statement.pdf) for more details.
