## About ##

I am currently a postdoc at __USC (Viterbi School)__ hosted by [__Meisam Razaviyayn__](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/research/).  
Before that, I was on a one-year postdoc at Inria Paris working with [__Francis Bach__](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).  
I defended my PhD thesis at the University of Grenoble Alpes, supervised by [__Anatoli Juditsky__](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [__Zaid Harchaoui__](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html).

## Research Interests ##

I work on various theoretical aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, such as: 
* statistical optimality and fast learning rates
* efficient algorithms
* adaptivity to the unknown structure and parameters
* robustness
