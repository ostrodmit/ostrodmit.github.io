In 2019--2021 I was a postdoc at USC Viterbi with [Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/research/). Previously, I was an ERCIM Alain Bensoussan fellow at Inria Paris hosted by [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).  
I graduated with a PhD in 2018. My advisors were [Anatoli Juditsky](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html). I also collaborated with [Arkadi Nemirovski](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/).

## Research ##

I work on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, in particular:  
* statistical optimality and fast learning rates
* efficient optimization algorithms, in particular for min-max optimization
* adaptation to unknown structure and parameters
* robust statistics
* hypothesis testing

See my [__research statement__](assets/research_statement.pdf) for more details.
