I am currently a postdoc at INRIA Paris in the group of [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).
I defended my PhD thesis at Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, supervised by [Anatoli Juditsky](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Anatoli.Iouditski/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html) (now at the University of Washington, Seattle).

I work on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, such as: 
* statistical optimality;
* algorithmic efficiency;
* adaptivity to the unknown structure and parameters;
* robustness.

I maintain a research blog [Look at the Corners](https://ostrodmit.github.io/blog/), feel free to check it out.
