I work on various aspects of machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing, in particular:  
* statistical optimality and fast learning rates
* efficient optimization algorithms, in particular for min-max optimization
* adaptation to unknown structure and parameters
* robust statistics
* hypothesis testing

See my [__research statement__](assets/research_statement.pdf) and [__list of publications__](/papers) for more details.
